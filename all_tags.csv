RTS,Trust,The role of the public service and the trust it must maintain in a context of dilution of reality is more important than ever
Aftonbladet,Use case,"Aftonbladet’s journalists can use AI technology in their work to produce material. This can, for example, involve doing research, predicting ideas or giving suggestions for headlines."
AJP,Use case,"More generally, the AJP notes that several editorial staff have already positioned themselves on the good and bad uses of AI and therefore do not put all technological tools on the same footing, thus differentiating AI producing from AI content as an aid to journalists. Among the ���good��� uses listed by several international media: translation of texts, production of short texts for social networks, suggestion of titles, search for subjects and themes, improvement of Google referencing, suggestion of article plans or titles , generation of interview questions, summary of old reports, creation of infographics or data visualization. Among the ���bad��� ones, which some media have also banned: texts and images generated by AI and the reproduction of voices."
ANP,Use case,"so-called ‘generative AI’, ‘templating’ or ‘text-to-speech’ and ‘speech-to-text’."
ANP,Use case,"can be inspired by the computer (or by AI) for headlines, backgrounds, story ideas or sources to be accessed, for example. Also - for example - recorded texts can be written out automatically and other support services applied. The number of assistance options is bound to increase further. It is up to editors whether it is relevant and useful whether AI applications are used in editorial or journalistic productions. Simply put: AI is, as it looks, a tool and not a substitute."

CDJM France,Use case,automated translation of articles published in a foreign language - advanced voice synthesis (text to speech) for automatic oral reading of texts - automated updating of content based on new data available available data - classification of articles by keywords - summaries of articles or audiovisual elements - generation of simplified French versions - factual summaries of election results - technical reports of sporting events
Dagens Næringsliv,Use case,improving the journalistic workflow and presenting our journalism in the best possible way
Dagens Næringsliv,Use case,"Examples of use are; proofreading, translation, transcribing, title suggestions, summarizing, idea development and metadata generation."
Dagens Næringsliv,Use case,"DN collaborates with Amedia on the development of language models for news written in Norwegian. This is currently used to recommend relevant articles in the stock exchange service Investor, in our wine search and at the bottom of articles. Algorithms contribute to the placement of content on certain floors on DN.no. This means that the content may look different to different visitors."
De Volksrant,Use case,"That said, artificial intelligence can serve as a tool for final editing, research and as a tool. For example, to transcribe audio recordings of an interview, to have texts translated or to have stories narrated by synthetic voices so that readers can listen to them."
France Info,Use case,"For example, we use software called Trint for automatic audio transcription"
France Info,Use case,"We use software called Data Miner, which allows us to detect information and events occurring through social networks, notably Twitter"
France Info,Use case,"So it detects, let’s say, an explosion somewhere, a fire. And that allows our journalist to be alerted. It doesn’t do the work for them at all. In fact, once again, it’s alert, and then, we have a partnership with a laboratory called Inria, on our true and false cell, for verifying information. It’s a tool developed for us by them, called State Check, which helps us with fact-checking. This means that it will detect, among tweets from politicians or personalities, quantitative elements of figures on which we will then be able to work."
Heidi.news,Use case,"Artificial intelligence can assist journalists in refining raw data in the same way as software such as Excel, and as an aid to writing articles, like online thesauruses or automatic spellcheckers."
Keystone - ATS,Use case,Examples of indication concerning content produced by Keystone-ATS Dispatch on the filling level of gas reservoirs/dam lakes: this dispatch was automatically generated on the basis of data from the Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) and the Gas Infrastructure Europe federation (GIE) and reread before distribution. Ice hockey – match results telegrams (identical to telegrams for handball): The telegrams are automatically generated with data provided by the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation and reread before broadcast. Results of the Swiss Loto and EuroMillions draws: this dispatch was produced with the support of Loterie Romande. It was automatically generated and proofread before broadcast. Covid-19 statistics: this dispatch was automatically generated based on FOPH data and reread before broadcast. Infographics (Lena): this infographic was produced automatically by the writing robot Lena. Images: (in the “Special Instructions” field) “Artificial intelligence used” or “AI used” or “Artificial Intelligence applied” or “AI applied”.
Le Figaro,Use case,"Journalists will be able to use this technology in their preparatory work (synthesis of documents and databases, assistance with translation, etc.), before writing their articles. It can also help with layout or spelling correction, and can speed up the process of subtitling videos, or even their translation into other languages. But the group undertakes not to automate these processes."
Le Monde,Use case,"several dozen articles produced by the editorial staff and translated into English. Each of these articles is subject to translation in three stages: the first “layer” of translation is carried out by the DeepL automatic translation software, the second by a professional translator (human!), the third by a English-speaking journalist."
Le Monde,Use case,"This project would not have been possible without the improvement in the performance of translation software: the cost in working hours of a 100% human translation would have been dissuasive in view of the expected income. It is the progress of AI that has made it possible to believe that it could find its economic balance within a reasonable time. Ultimately, several jobs for English-speaking journalists were created within the editorial staff of Le Monde, so AI is not necessarily synonymous with job destruction."
Le Monde,Use case,Another example of an additional service offered by Le Monde to its readers thanks to the controlled use of AI: the provision of an audio version of the articles.
Le Monde,Use case,"Finally, AI helps the team that moderates comments from Le Monde subscribers to identify messages that do not respect our contribution charter. Here again, nothing can replace a human eye and a human brain to thwart the treasures of ingenuity that some people demonstrate in flirting with the limits defined by the rules set."""
Mediafin,Use case,"We can use algorithms to optimize the digital distribution of our journalistic production, whether in newsletters, positions on the site or in the L'Écho application. We also make personalized content recommendations, for example in the “Selected for you” section and the “L’Écho Dimanche” newsletter. These algorithms are continuously tested and evaluated."
Mediafin,Use case,"We can use it, for example, to translate a working document or carry out research in a mass of documents in order to have more time to analyze them in depth and identify the most relevant trends. Before validating and using AI tools, we carefully test and evaluate them."
Nordic Journalism Network,Use case,Examples where AI can be used without actively sharing information with the audience: Transcribing for internal use does not affect the content or credibility of the published material. The focus should be on the finished result of the transcription rather than on the method used to achieve it.
Nordic Journalism Network,Use case,"Proof-reading software is a common feature that does not affect the substance or authenticity of the journalism. The goal is to deliver correctly spelled texts to the audience, not which tools are used to achieve it."
Nordic Journalism Network,Use case,"SEO work is part of the editorial and commercial process to make content more visible and accessible to a wider audience. It is the result of SEO strategies that are of interest to the audience, rather than the technical methods used to implement them."
Roularta,Use case,"Artificial intelligence, already used in our titles as an automation tool (machine learning, recommendations, targeting, etc.), has recently reached a new level with the advent of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models."
Roularta,Use case,"We also reserve the right to use AI as an enrichment, research or synthesis tool to help and fuel the work of journalists. Journalists can use these tools as a search engine, for example, but must always return to their own sources to guarantee the origin of their information."
Roularta,Use case,"as with texts, we can use AI as a tool to summarize videos, in particular to facilitate their distribution on different platforms."
RTS,Use case,"AI must be understood as a tool that does not replace but supports creativity, analysis, perspective or again for example investigation."
STT,Use case,"For example, you can ask ChatGPT for ideas and suggestions for interesting angles and headlines, or try its ability to version stories."
SVT,Use case,"podcast recommendations and news curation, among other things."
